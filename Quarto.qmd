## Quarto Ben Ofori-Kuragu

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Define the function
h <- function(x) {
  (cos(4 * x) + tan(0.5 * x))^4
}

# Plot the function over the interval [0, 1]
curve(h, from = 0, to = 1, xlab = "x", ylab = "h(x)", main = "Plot of h(x) over [0, 1]")

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(babynames)

# Define the names of interest
selected_names <- c("Alice", "John", "Emma")  # Replace with your chosen names

# Filter and wrangle the babynames data to focus on selected names
wrangled_data <- babynames %>%
  filter(name %in% selected_names) %>%  # Keep only selected names
  group_by(year, name, sex) %>%  # Group by year, name, and gender
  summarise(total_count = sum(n), .groups = "drop")  # Sum counts by year and gender

# View wrangled data
head(wrangled_data)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
